## Player Agency
Several things have always bothered me about player agency in 5e, generally about limitations around the initiative system and trying to build around magic items in a fair and balanced way. Many of the changes are based on giving players more choices, or set clearer expectations about these topics.

## Martial / Caster Imbalance
Iterating on this problem.

## 15 Minute Adventuring Days
A large issue with 5e that exacerbates the caster imbalance, as well as skewing balance away from short rest classes, is the assumptions around how many encounters players will have each day. Where the system assumes several combats within a day, a large majority of tables end up having 1 or 2 large combats (ie. a 15 minute adventuring day). This leads to classes with large resource pools being able to dump huge amounts of value into those encounters, while classes relying on more consistent short rests have a smaller resource pool to expend. Changes to the resting and travel systems will hopefully make it harder or at least less consistent for long rest classes to regain all of their resources, as well as codify more natural opportunities for encounters that can drain player resources.

## Resting and Travel
Travel is a poorly supported pillar of the game in 5e, I want to make the journey more interesting and challenging by adding a more structured set of rules for both players and the dm to interact with. These should also add more varied skill checks that incentivize the use of underrepresented skills.

## Inspiration
The inspiration system often gets forgotten about, so giving it more specific rules, as well as giving players more options when using inspiration should make it more impactful.
