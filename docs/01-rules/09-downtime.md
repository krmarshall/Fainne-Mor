## Modified Activities

### Crafting an Item
Due to well established workers unions the standard workweek constitutes 4 days of work and 3 days of rest. (This is just to make math easier for crafting things like consumables or with features such as the Artificers Magic Item Adept that affect crafting times.)

Scribing a 2nd level spell scroll requires 2 days instead of 3. (Again makes math easier.)
