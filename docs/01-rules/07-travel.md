## Using a Map
These rules assume that the group is using a map, and that the map can be divided into hexes (or another shape). Each hex contains one of the following environments: 

**Environment Types.** Roads, Grassland, Coastal, Desert, Arctic, Underdark, Swamp, Hills, Forest, Mountains, Water, Urban. 

**Cities.** Any location in a city can usually be reached within one day, but getting lost and completing activities is still possible. The random encounter table is modified for cities.




## Time
Travel is tracked in days and hexes. One set of rolls is made per day, and a number of hexes will be traversed per day depending on the environment, the mode of travel, and whether the party pushes themselves.

### Sleeping in the Wild
Whenever you sleep in the wilderness, you cannot benefit from a long rest. This includes somewhere temporary like a cave or tent, or other squalid conditions. Long rests require at least poor conditions: safe and comfortable places like a wizard’s tower, a permanent and maintained treehouse, or a secure room safe from the weather and wandering monsters.

For more comprehensive rules on resting see [here](./06-resting.md)




## Travel Procedure
Each day the party travels through a region, perform the following steps: 

**Step 1.** The players choose the hexes they want to travel through within 8 hours, or alternatively have at least one PC search for a known location or creature and let the DM choose the hexes based on whether the search succeeds or not. 

**Step 2.** Each PC chooses one of the following activities to perform while travelling: **navigate, search, forage, utilize vehicle, on watch, support, motivate, chronicle, or craft.**

**Step 3.** While the players are choosing their activities, the DM rolls on the Random Encounter table and prepares the encounter. If it’s an Environment Hazard, introduce it after the players have picked their activities but before the DCs are determined. 

**Step 4.** The PCs resolve their activities, and roleplay any scenes they’d like to have. 

**Step 5.** If an encounter was rolled and it wasn’t a Hazard, the DM introduces it. 

**Step 6.** The players choose whether to do a forced march, and which additional hexes they will travel through.

### Hours Per 5-6 Mile Hex
| Environment | On Foot | Vehicle |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Road, Grassland, Coastal, Desert, Arctic, Underdark | 2 | 1 |
| Swamp, Hills | 3 | 2 |
| Forest, Mountain path | 4 | 3 |
| Mountains | 8 | 6 |
| Water | 8 | 2 |
| Air | N/A | 2 |

#### Other Hex Sizes Table
| Miles Across | Hour Multiplier | Repeat Steps 2-5... |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | x0.5 | twice a day |
| 10-12 | x2 | every 2 days |
| 24 | x4 | every 4 days |

#### Other Hex Sizes
If your map uses a different hex size, refer to the table above. Steps 1 and 6 are always done once a day.

### Variant: One Hex at a Time
Sometimes you might want to move one hex at a time, such as when you don’t know what the map looks like. If that’s the case, repeat Steps 1, 3, 5 and 6 every hex, except that on Step 3, the DM flips a coin and only rolls on the Random Encounter table if it’s heads. Once the players decide not to travel any further that day, perform Steps 2 and 4.

### Vision - NEEDS REWORK
~~The party can always see if neighboring hexes are mountains. For any hex size other than 24 miles, the party can see any terrain type in each neighboring hex, unless they are currently in a forest or mountain hex.~~

### Travel Distance
The party can reasonably travel for 8 hours each day. The number of hexes that can be traversed depends on the environment, as shown in the Hours Per 5-6 Mile Hex and Other Hex Sizes tables. These numbers assume that the party possesses any appropriate gear, such as snow shoes or mountaineering equipment. 

**Vehicles and Mounts.** Mounts (or a vehicle) might allow the party to traverse more hexes in a day. Not all vehicles are applicable in all environments however. For example, carriages are likely only usable on roads, and most vehicles will not be any faster than walking in forests or mountains.

**Forced March.** If the party wants to traverse more hexes, they can travel for up to 16 hours in a single day, instead of the normal 8. Each additional hour costs each character 1 Hit Die, or one level of exhaustion. 

**Stealth.** Travelling undetected relies on spotting threats before they spot you. See the On Watch activity, described in the next section. 

**Rotating Shifts.** If the party is travelling on a vehicle large enough for them to rest, and the creatures operating the vehicle (such as horses, oarsmen, boiler room workers, or captain) can change at least every 8 hours, the party can travel for 24 hours a day.




## Travel Activities
This section outlines the activities that a character can perform while travelling. Each character can perform one activity per day. 

**Rangers.** Rangers can perform two activities. 

**Outlander Background.** The Wanderer feature is replaced with the following: "In addition to your normal choice of activity when travelling, you can perform the Navigate or Forage activity." 

**DCs.** DCs are determined using two tables: Activity DCs and Activity DC Modifiers. 

**Multiple environments.** All activities and encounters occur in the most common environment travelled through that day. 

**Multiple characters.** If multiple characters perform the same activity, each character rolls as normal and only the highest result is used.

### Navigate
You navigate the wilderness, aiming to keep track of where you are and not get lost. The DC is determined by the environment the party is travelling through and any relevant modifiers, as described in the Activity DC tables. On a success, the party follows the planned route. On a failure, the party is lost. If the DC is 0 or less, the party cannot get lost (and therefore a navigator is not required). 

**Example Proficiencies.** Wisdom (Survival), Intelligence (Navigator’s Tools). 

**Becoming Lost.** If the party becomes lost, draw a square on the map with the party’s starting location in one corner and each side length equal to the number of hexes the party traversed, covering the hexes the party could theoretically be in. The DM then secretly chooses or randomly decides which hex within the square the party is in. The DM tells the party what environment they’re in and describes any landmarks in the hex, but doesn’t give them any more information than that. It’s up to the party to solve their predicament!

### Forage
You forage for food and water. The DC is determined by the environment the party is in and any relevant modifiers, as described in the Activity DC tables. On a success, you find enough food and water to feed the PCs for the day. If you beat the DC by 10+, you also find enough for the PCs’ mounts and close companions. Each unfed creature consumes 5 sp worth of rations for the day or loses 1 Hit Die. If they have no remaining Hit Dice, or don’t eat or drink for a number of days equal to their Constitution modifier, they gain a level of exhaustion. 

**Example Proficiencies.** Intelligence or Wisdom (Survival or Nature).

:::note Don't Track Rations - Just Track Water
Water is heavier and more vital than rations. 10 pounds of water is required each day, compared to 2 pounds of food, and a few days without water can be deadly.

Assume that the party can travel with 3 days worth of water per person. If they have a vehicle (or mount) carrying a barrel of water, the party has a week’s worth of water. This rule-of-thumb is enough to make foraging both simpler and more important. 

~~To prevent water being trivial to acquire, magic below 3rd level cannot provide hydration.~~
:::

### Search
You are tracking a creature or searching for something. Regardless of what you are searching for, calculate the DC using the Activity DC tables, based on the environment the party is in and any other relevant factors. On a success, choose one of the following: 
- You find what you’re looking for, if the DM knows it’s in the hexes you travelled through. 
- Roll d10+10, and choose whether to replace the DM’s Random Encounter roll for the day with the new roll (without knowing what the DM rolled). If an Environment Hazard has already been introduced, the roll would be in addition to the Hazard, instead of replacing it. 

**Example Proficiencies.** Intelligence or Wisdom (Survival, Investigation or Perception).

### Support - NEEDS REWORK
You help the party handle the wilderness with supporting tasks like preparing meals or alcohol, tending to injuries, or repairing shoes or gear. 

The DC is 10 + the average party level. On a success, the party does not lose a Hit Die for sleeping in the wild that day, and other party members can add a d4 to their Activity checks. 

**Example Proficiencies.** Intelligence or Wisdom (Medicine, Cook’s Utensils or Brewer’s Supplies), Intelligence or Strength (Cobbler’s Tools), Intelligence or Dexterity (Weaver’s Tools).

### Motivate - NEEDS REWORK
You motivate the party to keep the pace up by playing music, coaching, persuading or intimidating the party. 

The DC is 10 + the average party level. On a success, the first 3 hours of a forced march that day don’t cost Hit Dice, and players can add a d4 to any initiative checks that day. 

**Example Proficiencies.** Charisma (Persuasion), Strength or Charisma (Intimidate or Athletics), Wisdom or Charisma (Musical Instrument).

### On Watch
You vigilantly keep a look out for creatures and hazards. If other creatures are also on watch, spotting them before they spot the party requires a succeeding at a contested Wisdom (Perception) check. Otherwise you always spot them first. Seeing creatures early allows the party to avoid them using normal stealth rules, if desired. 

You also have a chance to spot some Environment Hazards more quickly, using the environment’s Search DC. 

**Example Proficiencies.** Wisdom (Perception).

### Utilize Vehicle
Whether its skillful control, tender caring of animals, or clever adjustments, vehicles and mounts can be pushed to travel faster. 

The DC to utilize a vehicle (or mount) in this way is determined by the environment the party is in and any relevant modifiers, as described in the Activity DC tables. On a success, the first 3 hours of a forced march that day don’t cost Hit Dice, and you have advantage on any checks or saving throws made to control the vehicle (or mount). 

**Example Proficiencies.** Dexterity, Intelligence or Wisdom (Vehicle (Land or Water)), Wisdom (Animal Handling), Strength or Intelligence (Carpenter’s, Smith’s, or Tinker’s tools).

### Chronicle - NEEDS REWORK
You chronicle the party’s journey, creating a record such as drawings, songs, poems, a journal, or maps. Any chronicle you create has a set amount of value, either in gold pieces or services. For example you could recount the chronicle at taverns for free food and beds, or sell copies of the work to a library or guild. 

Roll an ability check with one of the skills or toolkits below that you are proficient with. The chronicle has a gp value equal to the result. The value is doubled if you discover a new location or creature in the area. 

If you roll above the environment’s navigation DC, the party can travel the same route without making a navigation check in future. This includes backtracking if you become lost. 

**Example Proficiencies.** Intelligence (History, Performance, Musical Instrument, Forgery kit or Cartographer’s tools), Intelligence or Dexterity (Calligrapher’s or Painter’s supplies).

### Craft - COULD USE REWORK
Each day, you gather materials from the environment and craft one of the following, depending on the toolkit you use. The DCs are presented in the Activity DC table. 

**Potion of Healing.** You find ingredients and create a potion of healing. Roll Intelligence or Wisdom (Herbalism or Poisoner’s kit, or Alchemist’s supplies). 

**Magic Ink.** You find a faintly magical liquid in a plant or carcass, and either scribe a cantrip or 1st level spell you know, or create a letter or artwork that causes the first viewer to be under the effect of the Suggestion spell. Roll Intelligence or Wisdom (Forgery kit, Painter’s or Calligrapher’s supplies, Cartographer’s tools). 

**Poison.** You find ingredients and create a mild poison. It is an ingestion or injury poison, and causes the target to become poisoned for an hour if they fail a DC 15 Constitution Saving Throw. Roll Intelligence or Wisdom (Brewer’s or Alchemist’s supplies, Cook’s utensils, Herbalism or Poisoner’s kit). 

**Temporary Protection.** You find materials and craft a makeshift piece of protective equipment. It provides +2 AC for up to 7 days until it prevents an attack that would otherwise hit the wearer. Roll Strength or Wisdom (Woodcarver’s, Carpenter’s, Leatherworker’s, Cobbler’s, Potter’s or Weaver’s tools).

**Sharpened Weapon.** You find strange wood, a high-quality whetstone, or something similarly appropriate. With the materials you craft or sharpen a weapon. It deals +5 damage the first time it hits. Roll Dexterity or Wisdom (Mason’s, Smith’s, Tinker’s, Jeweler’s, Woodcarver’s or Carpenter’s tools). 

**Special material.** At the DM’s discretion, you can also gather materials to craft other things, though some may take longer than a day to make or require more materials.
