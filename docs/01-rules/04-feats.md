### Shield Master
You use shields not just for protection but also for offense. You gain the following benefits while you are wielding a shield:

- **Changed:** If you take the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action to try to shove a creature within 5 feet of you with your shield. **You can use this bonus action upon declaring an attack, but before making any attacks.**
- If you aren't incapacitated, you can add your shield's AC bonus to any Dexterity saving throw you make against a spell or other harmful effect that targets only you.
