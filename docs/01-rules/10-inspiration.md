## Benefits of Inspiration
Inspiration can be used to gain one of the following benefits: 

**Your roll.** Roll an additional d20 on any roll you make. You can use this ability after the original roll, but before the outcome is revealed. 

**Your enemy’s roll.** After an enemy rolls a saving throw against an effect you made, roll a d20 and choose whether the enemy uses their roll or yours. 

**Flashback.** Have a “flashback” to something in the past where you did something small, such as buying a healing potion or other gear, learning information, or casting a ritual spell.

## Using Inspiration
To use Inspiration, you call on one of your personal characteristics (Personality Traits, Ideals, Bonds, or Flaws). The characteristic should be relevant to the current situation, ideally motivating the action the character is taking at the time. Try to avoid utilizing the same characteristic twice in a row.

It’s up to you how connected your chosen characteristic is to the scene – the DM can’t deny you your use of Inspiration. That said, players should be encouraged to portray something about their character, whether it’s a silly one-liner, yelling something dramatic, or revealing something about their character’s backstory or feelings. 

You can only use Inspiration once per round or skill challenge.

## Gaining Inspiration
You can gain inspiration in any of the following ways: 

**Recap.** Summarize the previous sessions events, or more specifically your characters actions/feelings at the start of a gaming session. Every player involved gains inspiration.

**Temptation.** If any player (including you, or the DM) notices a situation where a characteristic of your PC might make the situation more complicated, they can propose a temptation. If you accept the temptation, you must roleplay the characteristic in a way that complicates the situation. In exchange, you can gain inspiration. 

If you propose a temptation for your own character, it’s up to the DM whether to accept or refuse it. Examples of complications include insulting an NPC, stealing something, or letting your curiosity, pride or honor get the best of you. 

**At Death’s Door.** Whenever you fail a saving throw to end being incapacitated or unconscious (for example, being stunned or at 0 hit points), you can describe a past experience “flashing before your eyes”. It should be something the group doesn’t already know, such as a moment from your backstory, and could be related to one of your personal characteristics. Doing so grants your character inspiration.

**Growth.** If your character grows or changes through the course of play you can change or replace a relevant characteristic to reflect the change. Doing so grants your character inspiration. This type of renewal will likely occur less often than the other types.

You either have inspiration or you don’t you can’t stockpile multiple “inspirations” for later use.

:::note Finding The Line In The Sand
Character growth won’t happen every session, but when it happens it can be a tonne of fun. For example, a character might have the ideal, "Honor above all else", but during the session have to sacrifice their honor in order to save their friend. Clearly honor wasn’t above all else! Pushing characters to their limit is a great skill for DM’s to practice, and can be very rewarding. How the player updates their character’s ideal to react the change is how the character grows, and the rules in this chapter and Chapter 6 reward them for that growth.
