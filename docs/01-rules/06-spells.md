## Barkskin
**Change:** Removed concentration

Source: Player's Handbook

*2nd-level transmutation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a handful of oak bark)

**Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a willing creature. Until the spell ends, the target’s skin has a rough, bark-like appearance, and the target’s AC can’t be less than 16, regardless of what kind of armor it is wearing.

***Spell Lists.*** Druid, Ranger



## Find Traps
**Change:** Increased duration

Source: Player's Handbook

*2nd-level divination*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 10 minutes

You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of sight.
A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the alarm spell, a glyph of warding, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.

This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You don’t learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.

***Spell Lists.*** Cleric, Druid, Ranger



## Prayer of Healing
**Change:** Lowered cast time due to short rest changes

Source: Player's Handbook

*2nd-level evocation*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range each regain hit points equal to 2d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

***Spell Lists.*** Cleric, Paladin



## Catnap
**Change:** Lowered cast time due to short rest changes

Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything

*3rd-level Enchantment*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** S, M (a pinch of sand)

**Duration:** 1 minute

You make a calming gesture, and up to three willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range fall unconscious for the spell’s duration. The spell ends on a target early if it takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake. If a target remains unconscious for the full duration, that target gains the benefit of a short rest, and it can’t be affected by this spell again until it finishes a long rest.

***Spell Lists.*** Artificer, Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard



## Hunger Of Hadar
**Change:** Added overcast scaling

Source: Player's Handbook

*3rd-level conjuration*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 150 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a pickled octopus tentacle)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You open a gateway to the dark between the stars, a region infested with unknown horrors. A 20-foot-radius sphere of blackness and bitter cold appears, centered on a point with range and lasting for the duration. This void is filled with a cacophony of soft whispers and slurping noises that can be heard up to 30 feet away. No light, magical or otherwise, can illuminate the area, and creatures fully within the area are blinded.

The void creates a warp in the fabric of space, and the area is difficult terrain. Any creature that starts its turn in the area takes 2d6 cold damage. Any creature that ends its turn in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 acid damage as milky, otherworldly tentacles rub against it.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of both effects increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

***Spell Lists.*** Warlock



## Forcecage
**Change:** Added concentration

Source: Player's Handbook

*7th-level evocation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 100 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (ruby dust worth 1,500 gp)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

An immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a cage or a solid box as you choose.

A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart.

A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out of the area.

When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage’s area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.

A creature inside the cage can’t leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can’t exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.

This spell can’t be dispelled by Dispel Magic.

***Spell Lists.*** Bard, Warlock, Wizard



## Time Stop
**Change:** Lowered spell level

Source: Player's Handbook

*7th-level transmutation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. No time passes for other creatures, while you take 1d4 + 1 turns in a row, during which you can use actions and move as normal.

This spell ends if one of the actions you use during this period, or any effects that you create during this period, affects a creature other than you or an object being worn or carried by someone other than you. In addition, the spell ends if you move to a place more than 1,000 feet from the location where you cast it.

***Spell Lists.*** Sorcerer, Wizard
