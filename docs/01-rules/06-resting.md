title: Resting
---

## Short Rests
- Required duration reduced from 1 hour to 10 minutes.
- Cannot short rest more than 3 times per day.

## Long Rests
- Sleeping in the wilderness or unsafe locations such as dungeons does not confer the benefits of a long rest.
- Long rests in safe locations like cities and towns are unchanged.

To Do: build out framework for setting up camp for a day in the wilderness to gain the benefits of a long rest. Activities could be similar to travel such as forage, support, motivate, on watch, chronicle, or craft.
