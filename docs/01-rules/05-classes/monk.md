### Archetypal Monastic Tradition
When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level. **In addition to your choice you also count as being part of the Open Hand Tradition, and gain all of its respective features at the appropriate levels.**

### Hit Points
**Hit Dice:** **1d10** per monk level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** **10** + your Constitution modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** **1d10** (or **6**) + your Constitution modifier per monk level after 1st

### Martial Arts
- **Changed:** You gain all of this features benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing **heavy** armor or wielding a shield

### Ki
- **Changed:** Ki save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your **Dexterity** modifier
