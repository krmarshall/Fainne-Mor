## Archetypal Primal Path
At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels. In addition to your choice you also count as being part of the Berserker Path, and gain all of its respective features at the appropriate levels.
