### Iconic Primal Path

At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels. **In addition to your choice you also count as being part of the Berserker Path, and gain all of its respective features at the appropriate levels.**

### Path of the Berserker

#### Frenzy

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage **you can make an additional attack as part of your attack action.** When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion. **While raging you ignore all effects of exhaustion.**

#### Intimidating Presence

Beginning at 10th level, you can use your **bonus action** to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your **Strength** modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your **bonus action** to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.

If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.

### Primal Champion

At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is also increased by 4.
