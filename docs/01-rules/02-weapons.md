## Adjusted Weapons

### Shortsword
- Damage increased from 1d6 to 1d8 piercing.
- Reasoning: Rapiers shouldn't be the only decent finesse weapon, and I don't see two weapon fighting with shortswords being a particular balance problem.

### Net
- Thrown range increased from 5/15 to 10/20.
- Special rules reworked, read below. (Increased size limit, changed breakout saving throw, nets don't break, can multi attack)
- A Huge or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are form less, or creatures that are Gargantuan. A creature can use its action to make a Strength check of DC 8 + your proficiency, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, if youâ€™re able to make multiple attacks with that Attack, this Attack replaces one of them.
- Reasoning: Nets were balanced to be useless, due to their range profile they always had disadvantage, used all of your attacks if you had multi attack, and could be broken wasting your gold. Hopefully these changes should make nets at least a slight consideration for Tier 1 into maybe Tier 2 of play.

### Ammunition
The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use, firearms use bullets as ammunition.

### Reload
A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

### Longgonne
A particularly unwieldy weapon, attacks with the Longgonne while you are not prone have disadvantage. It also uses a special range profile seen below. The Sharpshooter feat only mitigates the long range profile, not the short range profile.

| Range | Attack Type |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Less than or equal to 30ft | Disadvantage |
| Between 30ft and 120ft | Standard |
| Greater than 120ft | Disadvantage |

The Longgonne uses special oversized ammunition that must be loaded 1 round at a time. Your ammunition options are listed below:

| Ammunition | Cost | Damage | Weight | Effects |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Ball | 1gp | 3d10 piercing | 0.5lb | Can hit a second target directly behind the primary for half (round down) the rolled damage. |
| Explosive | 2gp | 2d10 thunder | 0.5lb | On a successful hit each creature within 10ft. of the target must succeed on a DC 8 + proficiency bonus + dexterity modifier Dexterity save or take 2d10 thunder damage. |
| AP | 2gp | 3d10 piercing | 0.5lb | Ignores piercing damage resistances, and does half damage to targets with pierce immunity. Deals 2x damage to objects and constructs. |
