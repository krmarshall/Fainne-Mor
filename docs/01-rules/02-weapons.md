## Melee Weapons

### Shortsword
- Damage increased from 1d6 to 1d8 piercing.

## Ranged Weapons

### Net
- Thrown range increased from 5/15 to 10/20.
- Special rules reworked, read below: (Increased size limit, changed breakout saving throw, nets don't break, can multi attack)
- A Huge or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are form less, or creatures that are Gargantuan. A creature can use its action to make a Strength check of DC 8 + your proficiency, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, if youâ€™re able to make multiple attacks with that Attack, this Attack replaces one of them.

### Ammunition
The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use, firearms use bullets as ammunition.

### Reload
A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

### Drake Gun
A brutal close ranged weapon, the Drake Gun can be fired within 5 feet of a hostile creature without imposing disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls.

### Long Rifle
A particularly unwieldy weapon, attacks with the Long Rifle have disadvantage if you have moved this turn, and after making an attack with it your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn. It also uses a special range profile seen below. The Sharpshooter feat only mitigates the long range profile, not the short range profile.

| Range | Attack Type |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Less than 30ft | Disadvantage |
| From 30ft to 240ft | Standard |
| Greater than 240ft | Disadvantage |

The Long Rifle uses special oversized ammunition that must be hand loaded. You declare the type of ammunition used when firing the round, not when loading. Your ammunition options are listed below:

| Ammunition | Cost | Damage | Weight | Effects |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Ball | 1gp | 2d10 piercing | 0.5lb | Can hit a second target behind the primary for half (round down) the rolled damage. |
| HE | 2gp | d10 piercing | 0.5lb | On a successful hit each creature within 10ft. of the target must succeed on a Dexterity save (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or take d10 thunder damage. |
| AP | 2gp | 2d10 piercing | 0.5lb | Ignores piercing damage resistances, and does half damage to targets with pierce immunity. Deals 2x damage to objects and constructs. |
