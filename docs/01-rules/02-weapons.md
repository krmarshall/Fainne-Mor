## Adjusted Weapons

### Melee Weapons

#### Shortsword
- Damage increased from 1d6 to 1d8 piercing.

### Ranged Weapons

#### Net
- Thrown range increased from 5/15 to 10/20.

- Special rules reworked, read below: (Increased size limit, changed breakout saving throw, nets don't break, can multi attack)

- A Huge or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are form less, or creatures that are Gargantuan. A creature can use its action to make a Strength check of DC 8 + your proficiency, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, if youâ€™re able to make multiple attacks with that Attack, this Attack replaces one of them.

#### Ammunition
The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use, firearms use bullets as ammunition.

#### Reload
A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

#### Long Gun
A particularly unwieldy weapon, attacks with the Long Gun have disadvantage if you have moved this turn, and after making an attack with it your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn. It also uses a special range profile seen below. The Sharpshooter feat only mitigates the long range profile, not the short range profile.

| Range | Attack Type |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Less than or equal to 30ft | Disadvantage |
| Between 30ft and 120ft | Standard |
| Greater than or equal to 120ft | Disadvantage |

The Long Gun uses special oversized ammunition that must be loaded 1 round at a time. Your ammunition options are listed below:

| Ammunition | Cost | Damage | Weight | Effects |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Ball | 1gp | 3d10 piercing | 0.5lb | Can hit a second target directly behind the primary for half (round down) the rolled damage. |
| Explosive | 2gp | 2d10 thunder | 0.5lb | On a successful hit each creature within 10ft. of the target must succeed on a DC 8 + proficiency bonus + dexterity modifier Dexterity save or take 2d10 thunder damage. |
| AP | 2gp | 3d10 piercing | 0.5lb | Ignores piercing damage resistances, and does half damage to targets with pierce immunity. Deals 2x damage to objects and constructs. |
