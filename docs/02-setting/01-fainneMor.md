## Creation
Fainne Mor, or translated from the elven tongue as the Great Ring. A superstructure grown over 10,000 years ago by the elven druid circles utilizing their connection to the Weave. Legends from all the races tell of a great root system expanding out across the sky from the elven world of Domhain, creating a partial sphere around the systems sun. Over the course of centuries it expanded out, collecting up the other celestial bodies in the system and using them as raw material for its growth. Flaying the crusts off of the 3 inhabited planets of Terra, Saoghal, and Domhain itself. These planetary crusts were layed out on the rings inner plane to act as habitable regions, while the remaining planetary carcasses were either broken down for their resources, or thrown closer into the system to act as solar shades.

## Current State of the Ring
After the world altering magics and forces subsided the system has since been in a stable configuration. The Sun in the center of the system, 5 planetary cores orbiting inside the ring, 3 from the previously inhabited planets, and 2 from gas giants that were stripped of their outer materials and hauled inside the system. These cores act as solar shades to create the day night cycle so no matter where you are on the ring the days are ~16 hours of light and ~8 hours of darkness.

Finally the ring itself, in orbit approximately the same distance from the sun as Domhain was originally. Rotating over a thousand kilometers a second to create an artificial gravity comparable to that of pre-ring Domhain or Terra. The ring is roughly the middle half of a sphere, with the outer edges nearest the poles being sparsely connected roots, working out of the primary ring structure that is capped on both ends by large mountainous regions used to hold in the structures atmosphere. Within this primary ring are the planetary crusts that had been laid out in the ring, which act as the primary habitable regions for civilizations. Between these planetary islands are unfathomable kilometers of uncharted forest, an immense biosphere containing countless species even the druids haven't identified.

## Regions

### Hinterlands
The largely unexplored and wisely avoided forests that occupy most of the rings area between the planetary surfaces are known as the Hinterlands. Researchers, explorers, or those seeking profits from the unknown occasionally venture into the hinterlands, though many are never heard from again. Expeditions to cross the gulf between planetary regions have been attempted, most frequently between Domhain and Terra, but none of these adventurers have ever completed the centuries long journeys, or returned.

### Circumpolar Mountains
Both north and south edges of the ring are fringed by colossal mountains that keep the atmosphere from escaping. While it can't stop leakage entirely, it is slowed enough that capture of particles from the solar wind, and the occasional comet or asteroid provide enough material to replace what is lost. While mostly uninhabited there are research stations and some small dwarfen settlements through the regions. Occasionally parties even scale the mountains attempting to look over the edge of the ring. Though extreme precautions, expensive equipment, and heavy use of magic are required to make these trips survivable, and many corpses litter the mountainsides from those that were ill-prepared or simply unlucky.

### Domhain
The elven world from which Fainne Mor was originally grown. Largely composed of forests and inhabited by the elves and other fey creatures. The elven government is composed of many druid circles that each follow a different path, yet work together to maintain Fainne Mor and the Weave, which has an unusually strong connection to this region.

See the [Elves](./02-factions/01-elves.md) for more information on their civilization and the region.

### Saoghal
The dwarfen world that used to be a large moon of one of the outer systems gas giants before the rings birth. Extensively rocky, and previously much colder, the dwarfs relied on geothermal heat and relatively advanced technology before being roped nearer the sun, so much of their civilization is based beneath the mountains. There is much speculation on how such complex creatures could have evolved on the former moon, with dwarfs being evolutionarily very different from the other strange forms of life on the planet. 

See the [Dwarfs](./02-factions/02-dwarfs.md) for more information on their civilization and the region.

### Terra
The world occupied by humans with a very similar, yet more diverse biosphere to Domhain. When the druids approached humanity to discuss their integration into Fainne Mor they found a people shattered into various tribes with an incredibly fragmented history and culture. Historians have pieced together that humanity was a fairly advanced civilization, with ruined cities pointing towards some level of steam technology similar to that of the dwarfs. But a planet wide disaster, thought to be caused by a meteorite destroying most of a continent lead to extreme climate change that nearly wiped out humans and destroyed much of their history and technology. The people and biosphere have largely recovered, making large steps to more unified countries with the help of the elves and dwarfs during the post-ring period.

See the [Humans](./02-factions/03-humans.md) for more information on their civilization and the region.

## The Formation War
During the formation of the ring, the druid circles made contact with the other intelligent species to inform them of the coming process, and try to ease any worries the apocalyptic sounding process created. Many groups of humans were sceptical of the elves, but were not large or coordinated enough to form a meaningful opposition. Others made deals with the elves, to help them reform societies and reinvigorate some areas of the biosphere.

The dwarfs on the other hand, had a deep spiritual connection to their moon, the geological processes driven by the moons proximity to the gas giant provided much of the heat, energy, and materials the dwarfs used. The druids attempted to convince them that regular small meteorite impacts would supply the metals and stone they needed, and their planets ecosystems would grow and thrive in the greater warmth, but the dwarfs were united against this desecration of their world.

Thus the now dubbed Formation War began between the elves and dwarfs. The immense loss of life and widespread destruction are considered a shameful but necessary part of the elves history, and their records contain sparse detail of the events. Legends say some of the oldest and most powerful Archdruids still alive were present during those times, but few would dare discuss such things in their presence.

The dwarfs on the other hand have extensive legends and myths from the Formation War, for though they ultimately were unable to stop the druids from integrating Saoghal into the ring, they remember the event as a great transgression against their people. To this day the legends of dwarfen bravery, and the great evils of the druids are taught to young dwarfs, vowing as a people that one day they will have retribution.
