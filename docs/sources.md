## Inspiration

Star tree concept and the corrupted framework of Catholicism are largely from Dan Simmons Endymion / Rise of Endymion.

Many aspects from the Orcs, Dwarves, and Elves are inspired by Warhammer Fantasy / 40K.

## Homebrew Rules

A lot of homebrew rules were taken or adapted from [Caesars House of the Fifth](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qp2IC_nsS6HBCS8B2_Wmq1X7JH60_Txr/view)

## Travel and Resting

Large portions of travel and rest rules are adapted from/inspired by both [Caesars House of the Fifth](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qp2IC_nsS6HBCS8B2_Wmq1X7JH60_Txr/view) and Adventures In Middle Earth (Out of Print and can't find a publisher page to link?)
