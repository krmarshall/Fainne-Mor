## Inspiration

Star tree concept and the corrupted framework of Catholicism are largely from Dan Simmons Endymion / Rise of Endymion.

Many aspects from the Orcs, Dwarves, and Elves are inspired by Warhammer Fantasy / 40K.

## House Rules

A lot of house rules were taken or adapted from [Caesars House of the Fifth](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qp2IC_nsS6HBCS8B2_Wmq1X7JH60_Txr/view)
