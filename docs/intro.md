### [Homebrew Rules](/docs/rules/sources)

This campaign features some homebrew rules mainly to mitigate some of the issues and balance that have cropped up in 5e over the years. Also listed are explicitly allowed source materials and variant rules. If you cant find the answers to anything just shoot me a message.

### [Setting Details](/docs/setting/intro)

This campaign is placed in a custom setting heavily inspired by Warhammer 40k, The Rise of Endymion by Dan Simmons, and Warhammer Fantasy. See details about the world, factions, its history, maps, and more.

### [DM Notes](/docs/dmnotes/intro)

Don't be nosy. Contains plans, stat blocks, and general spoilers for the campaign. These are walled behind basically a piece of paper for security (docusaurus isn't really made to hide documentation), but I'm trusting you all not to go snooping too hard. I'll do my best to move relevant documentation, stat blocks, ect to visible categories when they get revealed in the campaign.

### [Sources / Inspiration](/docs/sources)

If you want to find the sources of any images or where the inspiration for specific elements are from see the Sources page.
